# CS-32-FP
Our CS32 Final Project (Dylan Park, Brian Kim, Allison Park)

## Our Plan
Dylan, Brian, and Allison intend to make an expanded version of Wordle called Wordle Unlimited. Wordle is currently a popular game, in which users have 6 attempts to guess the 5-letter word of the day. With each guess, Wordle checks each letter of the userâ€™s answer and tells the user whether or not the letters of their guess are in the actual word and if the correct letter is in the right location. Our version will have a word of variable length, but otherwise function similarly to Wordle. Some tools from class that we will be utilizing are accessing a dictionary of set words, using server and client relations, and utilizing RGB values. 

## Online Resources
Word list from https://svnweb.freebsd.org/csrg/share/dict/words?revision=61569&view=markup
## First Steps
We started by downloading and uploading a word list and then we created a function to revise the word list to better fit our functions
